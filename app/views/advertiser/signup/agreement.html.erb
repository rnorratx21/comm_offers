      I understand that this agreement is for a twelve (12) month term and will continue thereafter until I give Community Offers 
      a ninety (90) day written notice of termination, sent via Certified Mail. I will be charged for my plan prior to the first of each month. 
      The initial month's fee and setup costs will be charged upon your first invoice. Credit card, debit card and electronic funds transfer (EFT), 
      or check payments must be received by us to begin listing your offer. We will notify you in writing by email or mail should your payment 
      not be received on time. Unpaid amounts beyond thirty (30) days are subject to 2% interest per month and a late fee of $25 per month. 
      This Agreement shall be binding upon Advertiser’s successors and assigns and such successors and assigns must continue to honor the Agreement 
      for the remainder of its then current term.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any failure to honor the loyalty card, web coupons, SMS texting coupons or coupons on the accompanying Community Offers mobile sites 
      will be deemed to be a business libel to Community Offers which will cause irreparable harm to the business and reputation of 
      Community Offers and its other advertisers and may result in litigation. In such event this Agreement shall be terminated immediately 
      and all amounts due under the Agreement for the remainder of the then current term shall be immediately due and payable to Community Offers. 
      If Advertiser does not correct this or any other default under this Agreement within 14 days of the date Community Offers sends written notice
      thereof by mail, then this Agreement shall terminate and all amounts due hereunder for the remainder of the then current term shall be immediately
      due and payable to Community Offers.
