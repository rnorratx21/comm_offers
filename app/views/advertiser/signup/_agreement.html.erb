  <p><strong>The Community Offers web and mobile package</strong> includes an online searchable coupon to be placed on the communityoffers.com Web site and on the Community Offers app. I understand that this agreement is for a twelve (12) month term.  I also understand that I may cancel this agreement at any time with a 30 day notice prior to the next billing cycle, sent via email using the link provided on communityoffers.com.  Credit card payments must be received by us to begin listing your offer. We will notify you in writing by email or mail should your payment not be received on time.

This Agreement shall be binding upon Advertiserâ€™s successors and assigns and such successors and assigns must continue to honor the Agreement for the remainder of its then current term.</p>
  <p>Any failure to honor offers you have authorized on the Community Offers loyalty card, CommunityOffers.com web coupons, Community Offers SMS texting coupons or coupons on the accompanying Community Offers mobile sites will be deemed to be a business libel to Community Offers which will cause irreparable harm to the business and reputation of Community Offers and its other advertisers and may result in litigation. In such event this Agreement shall be terminated immediately and all amounts due under the Agreement for the remainder of the then current term shall be immediately due and payable to Community Offers. If Advertiser does not correct this or any other default under this Agreement within 14 days of the date Community Offers sends written notice thereof by mail, then this Agreement shall terminate and all amounts due hereunder for the remainder of the then current term shall be immediately due and payable to Community Offers.</p>
