The SQL files in this folder are executed once on the current ActiveRecord database connection
before the tests are run. Use them to set up a database schema and any contents (fixtures)
required by the tests. Tests are run in transactions and rolled back, so the database should
be restored back to the state defined in these files after each test.

It's important that all tables are created with option ENGINE=InnoDB, otherwise MySQL creates
MyISAM tables which do not support transactions.
