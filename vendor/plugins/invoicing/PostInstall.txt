Thanks for trying the Ruby Invoicing Gem. Hope you find it useful.
Do please blog and tweet about it (tag your posts with #invgem).

Now please go to the root of your Rails project and type:
    script/generate invoicing_ledger billing --currency=GBP
(replace GBP with your currency if you do not use Pounds Sterling).
